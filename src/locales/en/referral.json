  "rulesOverview": "Overview: Account levels range from S5 up to S0 (six levels in total), with S0 being the highest. Each level offers two-tier referral rewards, and the rebate rate varies by level. Rebates are calculated based on your own level. Example: If an S0 account invites A, the S0 account can earn up to 56% of A's trading fees on every trade. If A then invites B, the S0 account can additionally earn 14% of B's trading fees. Therefore, for an S0 account the Tier-1 cap is 56%, the Tier-2 cap is 14%, and the combined cap is 70%. If only A exists (no B), then only Tier-1 rebates apply.",
